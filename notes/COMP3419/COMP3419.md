### Digitalization: converting a signal from analogue => digital form
- *Sampling* : when we measure the signal's value at discrete intervals
- *Quantization* : when we restrict the value to a fixed set of levels

The *Shannon Sampling Theorems* – if the highest frequency
component of a signal is at $f_h$ , the signal can be properly
reconstructed if it has been sampled at a frequency greater than $2f_h$ .
This limiting value is known as the Nyquist rate.


### Digital Data Acquisition

### Visual Perception
1. Mach Bands
2. Simultaneous Contrast
3. Optical Illusion

#### Applications of Visual Perception
- Edge Detection
- Anti-aliasing
- Motion Blur
- Image Compression

### Digital Image Representation

The image digitalization process requires decisions about values for *M* (rows), *N* (colums), and for the number, *L*, of discrete gray levels allowed for each pixel.

$L = 2 ^ k$


The number, *b*, of bits required to store a digitized image is 


$b = M \times N \times k$


### Spatial Domain Image Processing

Spatial domain processes can be denoted by the expression: 

$ g (x,y) = T [ f (x,y) ] $

where *f (x,y)* is the input image, *g (x,y)* is the processed image, and
*T* is an operator on *f*, defined over some neighborhood of *(x,y)*.

#### Pixel Point Processing
$ s = T(r) $ where *r* and *s* are variables denoting, respectively, the gray level of $ f(x,y) $ and $ g(x,y) $ at any point $(x,y)$. 

#### Power-Law Transformation
$ s = c r^\gamma $ where *c* and $\gamma$ are positive constraints

### Window-Level Operation
 In this operation, an interval or window is selected in the original gray level
range, determined by the window center or level *l*, and the window width *w*.

where *M* is the largest gray level in
the original gray level range
(dynamic range).

### Image Enchancement - Histogram Processing
The *histogram* of a digital image with gray levels in the range $[0, L-1]$ is
a discrete function.

$h(r_k) = n_k$


where $r_k$ is the k-th gray level and $n_k$ is the number of pixels in the image having gray level $r_k$.

#### Normalized Histogram
It is common practice to normalize a histogram by dividing each of its
values by the total number of pixels in the image, denoted by n.

Thus, a normalized histogram is given by:

$p(r_k) = n_k / n$

where $p(r_k)$ gives an estimate of the probability of occurrence of gray
level $r_k$.

#### Histogram Equilization
Histogram equalization requires a mapping (via a transformation) to
stretch the histogram of the input image

$ s_k = T(r_k) = \sum_{j=0}^k {n_j/n}$

- $r_k$ is the k-th (k = 0, 1, ..., L-1) grey level
- $n_k$ is the number of pixels in the image with that grey level
- $n$ is the number of pixels in the image
- $s$ has as many elements as the original histogram

*s ∈ [0,1] and it has to be scaled as ss for constructing the resultant
image, i.e., ss ∈ [0, Max-grey-level-value]*

### Image Enchancement - Spartial Filtering
#### Definition:
The process consists simply of moving the filter mask from point to point in an image. At each point $(x,y)$, the response of the filter at that point is calculated using a predefined relationship. For linear spatial filtering, the response is given by a sum of products of the filter coefficients and the corresponding image pixels in the area spanned by the filter mask.

#### Math:
For a mask of size $m × n$, we assume that $m = 2a + 1$ and $n = 2b + 1$, where $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers. (mask with odd size)

 In general, linear filtering of an image $f$ of size $M × N$ with a filter mask of size $m × n$ is given by the expression:

$ g(x,y) = \sum_{s=-a}^{a} \sum_{t=-b}^{b} w(s,t) f(x+s, y+t)$, where $a = (m - 1) / 2$ and $b = (n - 1) / 2$. 

To generate a complete filtered image, the above equation must be
applied for x = 0, 1, 2, ..., M – 1 and y = 0, 1, 2, ..., N – 1.

#### Linear Smoothing Filters – Averaging filters

The output of a smoothing, linear spatial filter is simply the average of
the pixels contained in the neighborhood of the filter mask. 

#### Non-linear Smoothing Filters – median filter
To perform median filtering at a point in an image, we first sort the values of the pixel and its neighbors, determine their median, and assign this value to that pixel.
