COMP2129 - Operating Systems and Machine Principles
---------------------------------------------------

### Week 1:

#### Java vs C

```c
/* This program prints "Hello world." on a line and exits*/

public class HelloWorld
{
public static void main (String args[])
{
System.out.println ("Hello world.");
}
}

/*
› Variable argc stores number of arguments
› Variable argv pointers to arguments
*/
```

##### Differences

-	Control flow structures are the same.
-	References are called “pointers” in C
-	No garbage collection

	-	Programmer is responsible for allocating and freeing memory
	-	No classes or objects

-	A C-program consists of a set of files containing:

	-	global variables
	-	function definitions
		-	“main” is the first function invoked
		-	functions have local variables
